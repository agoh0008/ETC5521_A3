# ETC5521: Assignment 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis of Fairy Penguin Species

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 3 of the ETC5521 unit (Exploratory Data Analysis). 

This project aims to explore the extent of sightings of endangered Australian wildlife (in this case, fairy penguins) in relation to weather patterns and tourism activities. Weâ€™d like to know things like whether occurrences occur in particular locations, times of the year or day, and whether tourists travel to the locations to have a wild thing experience.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand various factors influencing the sightings of endangered Australian species. Specifically, we aim to investigate:
- **Locations:** Identifying specific regions where fairy penguin sightings are more frequent.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Analyzing occurrences based on time of the year and time of the day.
- **Weather Conditions:** Examining the relationship between weather patterns and fairy penguin sightings.
- **Tourism Impact:** Understanding if and how tourist activities correlate with fairy penguin sightings, including whether tourists specifically travel to these locations for wildlife experiences.
